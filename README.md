More details about the project here:

I wanted to practice using what I learned in JS 101 and JS 120 so I made a small web app that takes the amount of hours you study per week and the amount of hours you've already spent studying and estimates how long it will take you to finish Launch School.

If you have already finished JS 101 and 109 you can input how long it took you and it will give you a much more accurate estimate. I based it on the figures available on the 'How long will it take' at the forum. I took all the figures available and show the average time it takes to complete each course and the maximum time. Of course this is based on the figures publicly available in the forum so it's not 100% accurate, but it should give you a good idea of roughly how long it will take.

After getting an MVP together, I open-sourced it and a few other students from LS have been working on it, especially Antonina and Jack. I did this as I thought that some people would like to try contributing to a small project to learn how to create pull requests, create and fix issues and merge back to the main branch.

Any Launch School student that would like to contribute is welcome to. I recommend having at least gone through JS 120, although there are some minor issues that someone could fix after going through JS 101.

We have not studied design or CSS so the code is nowhere near perfect, in fact it needs a lot of refactoring. Some small issues we purposely left unfinished so people can contribute easily if they want to.
